# flight-mill
Flight mills are valuable machines for any entomologist interested in flight testing their bugs. The machine I built is inspired by Attisano et al. (2015), but I put my own 3D printing and laser cutting spin on it. For exact details please see my published paper on JoVE (doi: 10.3791/62171) or this preprint (https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bteznjf6). If youâ€™re more curious about seeing how my code and methods change in the future, keep checking this repository. This repository will have more exploratory flight mill code and methods (e.g. parallel processing, image-processing setup, etc.).
